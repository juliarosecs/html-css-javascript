		<h1>The Physics of Time Travel</h1>
			
			<div id="section1">
				<h2>Is Time Travel Real, or is it Just Science Fiction?</h2>
				<p>When most people think of time travel, they probably think about going back in time and visiting the past. Unfortunately, traveling backwards in time is <a href="http://www.astronomytrek.com/5-bizarre-paradoxes-of-time-travel-explained/">probably a bad idea</a> and might be impossible (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/11/14/how-traveling-back-in-time-could-really-physically-be-possible/#e9dfd8012db5">although there are some who disagree</a>). However, it is definitely possible to travel into the future. It's not easy to do, but the underlying physics is well established and is based on Einsteinâ€™s Theories of Special and General Relativity.</p>

				<h2>What is Time Dilation?</h2>
				<p>According to Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, time slows down the faster a person travels. This means that if you were to get in a rocket ship and travel very, very fast, time would flow more slowly for you, and you would age more slowly than people on Earth. This phenomenon is called time dilation. So, for instance, if you were in a rocket traveling past the earth at 99% the speed of light (664 million miles per hour, which is <em>very</em> fast!), time would pass seven times more slowly for you, meaning for every year you spend on your trip, seven years pass back on Earth. If you were to leave Earth in 2020 and spend 20 years (from your perspective) zooming around the cosmos, you would return 140 years later, in the year 2160. Everyone you knew would have passed away, but you would only be twenty years older than when you left. </p>

				<p>Before you pack your bags, though, you need to know that no rocket ever made goes anywhere near that fast. The fastest rocket we've ever made only goes 47,000 miles per hour, which is fast but not nearly fast enough to produce a significant time dilation. If you traveled at this speed for 20 years, you would only be 1.6 seconds younger than your friends on Earth.</p>

				<h2>Is This Completely Hypothetical?</h2>
				<p>Nope. In 1971, <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/airtim.html">two scientists named Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating put very sensitive clocks on airplanes</a> and found that they ran a little slower than similar clocks left on the ground. (The difference was less than a millionth of a second, however.)</p>

				<h2>Does Anything Else Cause Time Dilation?</h2>
				<p>Yes -- Time flows more slowly in stronger gravitational fields, although, again, it would take a very strong gravitational field to slow down time enough for this to be a legitimate form of time travel. This phenomenon is explained by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. Gravitational time dilation has been experimentally confirmed, however, even at very small distances. This means that, technically speaking, a person who lives in a penthouse apartment will age a <em>little</em> bit more quickly than someone who lives on the ground floor, but only by less than a second over the course of their entire life. While these time differences are small, they do come into play in our daily lives, even if we don't realize it. GPS satellites, for example, have to account for these time dilations in order to stay synchronized with clocks on Earth.
